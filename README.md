M3 prototype of app

Using a paid course to learn how to do this and then build it up to make it our own from there.

This is the run as a MERN project, from the root you can use "npm run dev" to start both the frontend and backend. Or run just the frontend from covid-frontend with "npm start" 
and the backend from the root of the project with "npm start"
to start both seperately.

npm install must be run too as I assume I don't need to explain
